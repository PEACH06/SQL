--Q1- SHOW THE HARDCORE ACTIVITIES

SELECT*
FROM smartwatch_exercise
WHERE exercise = "snowboarding"
OR exercise  = "ice_climbing"
OR exercise = "hiking";

--ABOVE IS MORE OF AN EXAMPLE USING "OR"
BELOW IS A BETTER EXAMPLE USING "IN"


SELECT *
FROM smartwatch_exercise
WHERE exercise 
IN ("snowboarding", "ice_climbing","hiking");

--Q2- NOW SHOW ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT AS HARDCORE

SELECT *
FROM smartwatch_exercise
WHERE exercise 
NOT IN ("snowboarding","ice_climbing","hiking");

--THE ABOVE TABLE WOULD SHOW STATIONARY BIKE, WALK, AND DANCE.

--Q3- ADD A NEW TABLE FOR A FRIENDS SMART WATCH ACTIVITY (COULD HAVE DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES)

CREATE TABLE  friend_smartwatch
(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOIINCREMENT,
exercise TEXT,
minutes INTEGER,
cals INTEGER,
heart_rate INTEGER,);

INSERT INTO smartwatch_exercise (exercise, minutes, cals, heart_rate) VALUES ("stationarybike", 20,90,80);
INSERT INTO smartwatch_exercise (exercise, minutes, cals, heart_rate) VALUES ("dance",23,91,80);

INSERT INTO smartwatch_exercise (exercise, minutes, cals, heart_rate) VALUES ("stengthtraining",25,98,85);

--Q4 -WHAT EXERCISES DOES THE FRIEND DO

SELECT exercise
FROM friend_smartwatch;

--THE TABLE WOULD SHOW STATIONARY BIKE DANCE ,WALK, SNOWBOARDING, KICKBOXING AND STRENGTH TRAINING

--TO ADD A QUERY WITHIN A QUERY (SUBQUERY)
--EXAMPLE BELOW

--Q5- WHAT ACTIVITIES DO BOTH FRIENDS DO? DO A QUERY WITHIN A QUERY

SELECT exercise
FROM samrtwatch_exercise
WHERE exercise IN 
(SELECT exercise
FROM friend_smartwatch)

table would show dance walk snow boarding stationary bike

--fOR NO DUPLICATES USE "DISTINCT"
--EXAMPLE

SELECT DISTINCT exercise
FROM smartwatch_exercise
WHERE exercise IN 
(SELECT exercise
FROM friend_smartwatch)
